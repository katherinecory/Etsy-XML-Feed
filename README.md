How to use
----------

Register a provisional app with Etsy Developers at https://www.etsy.com/developers/register. For more information about this process, read Etsy's handbook at https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation/getting_started/register. The app needs the following settings:

1. What type of application are you building? - **Seller Tools**
- Is your application commercial? Will you charge people to access the application? - **No**
- Who will be the users of this application? - **Just myself or colleagues**

Open and edit the etsyxml.php document. Replace the following variables:

  $api_key = "api_key";
  $username = "etsy_username";

When saved, view the source of the PHP page to see the XML output.
